# Weather_App

Description

The motivation of this porject is to use 3rd party API's to create a web and mobile friendly app. I built this app to utilize my API, dynamic Javascript, and css abilities. This code solves the problem of needing a web based weather app to search for your favorite cities and to save your recent searches. My biggest lesson from the this project is where I created a check to make sure no repeated names are included in the local storage so only one name shows up per city input.
